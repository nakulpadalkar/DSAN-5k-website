## Data Gathering

I Like Iris flowers, so I went to the local botanical garden. I then collected 150 samples of Iris flowers, 50 of each species. I measured the length and width of the petals and sepals of each flower. I then recorded the data in a CSV file. This file is located in `data/iris.csv`.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

iris = pd.read_csv('data/iris.csv')
iris.head()
```
